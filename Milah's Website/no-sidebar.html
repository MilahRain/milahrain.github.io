									<h2>Here Is Some Insight Into Who I Am!</h2>
									<p>Above is a collage of me and things I love</p>
								</header>
								<p>
									Hi! I’m Milah, a computer science and mathematics student based in Southern California with a passion for building, learning, and creating. 
											Technology has truly always fascinated me. Not just how it works, but how it can connect people, solve problems, and bring ideas to life.
											 Over the last few years, I’ve been exploring programming through school, self-guided projects, and lots of late-night debugging sessions.
											  My journey has been a mix of curiosity, persistence, and discovering just how much I enjoy making things that are both functional and meaningful.
								</p>
								<p>
									Outside of school, I spend a lot of time experimenting with different areas of tech: game creation and development, backend logic, data analytics, and anything that lets me learn something new. 
											I love taking on projects that challenge me, whether it’s building console programs, designing parts of my website from scratch, analyzing datasets, or figuring out how to make my 
											code cleaner and more efficient. I genuinely enjoy the process of growth, from not knowing where to start to watching something actually <em>work</em> because I built it.
								</p>
									<p>
										Throughout my studies, I’ve gained hands-on experience across several areas of computer science, including Assembly programming, C++, Java, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and foundational data analytics.
										 I’ve completed multiple console-based projects, built and refined my personal website from scratch, and learned how to work with Git/GitHub for version control and project organization. 
										 These projects have helped me develop strong problem-solving skills, an eye for detail, and a growing confidence in translating ideas into functional, real-world code — all of which continue 
										 to shape my goals in the field.

									</p>

								</p>
										When I’m not coding, you can usually find me enjoying the SoCal sun, working on my creative hobbies, playing with my two kittens, 
										or learning new skills that help me become a better developer and teammate.
										 I’m so excited to continue growing in the tech world, contribute to meaningful projects, and eventually work in a role where I can keep developing my craft. 
										 This is just my first chapter in my tech journey and I cannot wait to keep learning and growing.
										 Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit about me; I’m glad you’re here!
							</p>
