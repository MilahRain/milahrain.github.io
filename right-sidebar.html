											<h2>Java Script Projects</h2>
											<p></p>
										</header>
										<p>
											Java is the very first programming language I ever learned, and it became the foundation that shaped how I understand coding as a whole.
											 Starting with Java meant diving straight into a strongly typed, object-oriented world where structure and organization matter. 
											 At first, it felt overwhelming. Every piece of code had to be placed just right, and concepts like classes, methods, and data types were all brand new to me.
											  But learning Java early on gave me a solid framework for thinking logically, writing clean code, and understanding how programs are meant to be built from the ground up.
										</p>
										<p>
											As I became more comfortable with it, Java started to feel rewarding. 
											I enjoyed how its object-oriented approach allowed me to break larger problems into smaller components and design programs piece by piece.
											I discovered that I had a good sense for separating tasks into methods, organizing code clearly, and tracing how data moved through a project. 
											Java helped me develop a strong intuition for structure, which is something that has helped me immensely as I’ve moved on to other languages.
										</p>
										<section>
											
											<p>
											Of course, being my first language, Java came with challenges. 
											Concepts like inheritance, interfacing between classes, and debugging multi-file programs didn’t always click right away. 
											Sometimes I’d spend hours trying to understand why a program wasn’t behaving, only to realize one small detail was off. 
											But every challenge pushed me to think more deeply and become more confident in my problem-solving skills.
											</p>
											<p>
											Looking back, starting with Java was one of the best things that could have happened in my programming journey. 
											It gave me discipline, structure, and a strong technical foundation that helped make learning new languages far easier. 
											Even now, much of the way I approach logic and program design comes from those early Java lessons and I’m grateful
											 it was the language that introduced me to the world of coding.
